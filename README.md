# Symmetry UI
A UI made for [Symmetry project](https://www.grey-box.ca/project-symmetry/).

# Run Locally

Use your favorite package manager to install the dependencies and run the local server. I have used `pnpm` here, but any other would be fine. For example for npm, after you cloned the project:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```
or with yarn
```
yarn install
yarn vite
```
and with pnpm you can run it:
```
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```
